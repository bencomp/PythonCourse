    "# Visualisation with Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Research based on Text and Data Mining typically entails an approach in which linear texts are converted into quantitative data. The numbers that are generated out of these texts are often represented via graphs and diagrams. In contrast to numbers displayed in a tabular form, data visualisations quickly enable researchers to explore patterns and trends or notable exceptions to the general trends. During the last number of years, a large number of visualisation libraries have been developed for the Python language. One of the most widely used libraries is matplotlib. This tutorial concentrates on three types of visualisations that you can create using matplot: bar charts, line charts and scatter plots.\n",

    "To make use of the matplotlib library, you firstly need to import it. Many of the functions that are needed to create data visualisations are actually in matplotlib’s pyplot module, which can be imported as follows:"

    "While not strictly necessary, it is convenient to add a figure and a set of axes to a plot. They can be added using the code that you see on lines 14 and 15 in listing 4.1. The aliases that are used, fig and ax, are also conventional. A figure can be thought of as an empty canvas on which you can place your diagrams. Axes, secondly, is a class which consists of a combination of an X-axis and a Y-axis. These axes also includes the ticks and the labels for these ticks. All the data that you need for your visualization will be placed on these axes. \n",
    "Creating the bar chart is fairly straightforward. You can simply make use of the bar() method of Axes. At a minimal level, the method demands two parameters: the values that need to be shown on the X-axis, and the values that need to be shown on the Y-axis. In the case of bar charts, the former list needs to contain categorical values. The latter variable ought to be numerical and continuous. In the code above, the values that will be visualised are generated using the methods the methods keys() and values(), which are available by default for all Python dictionaries. The keys() method generates the words that are connected to the ticks on the X-axis. The values created using values() determine the heights of the various bars. \n",
    "The appearance of the bar chart can be adjusted via a number of additional parameters. You can specify the width, the opacity and the color of the bars, for instance. As values for ‘color’, you can provide hexadecimal colour codes. \n",
    "It is advisable, furthermore, to annotate and to describe your data visualisations as much as possible. You can add a label for the X-axis and the Y-axis using the methods set_xlabel() and set_ylabel(). The method set_title() may be used to add a general title to the plot. The string that is supplied within parentheses will be shown above the bar chart. \n",
    "Importantly, you need to conclude the code that creates the data visualisation with the command plt.show(). Without this command, the visualisation will not be created. As you will see when you run the code, this command opens an application which renders the bar chart. The command should be used only once.\n",

It visualises the data in a dictionary named freq, as in listing 4.1. In this case, however, the keys and the values of the dictionary are both numeric. A dictionary of this kind can be used in applications created to produce dispersion graphs for individual texts. \n",

The code places the value in ttRatio on the X-axis, and the values in sentlen on the Y-axis. The aim is of the visualisation is to explore differences between genres. In the example below, the first three texts are Gothic novels, and the last three texts are History novels. The colours of the dots indicate the genres of the novels."
