    "Variables names can consist of any combination of alphanumerical characters that you can think of. Underscores are also allowed in variable names. One important rule, however, is that variable names cannot begin with a number. Although it is possible to work with any sequence of characters, your script will evidently be most understandable when you make use of variable names which are meaningful. Unlike other languages, there is no special symbol which indicates that the variable is indeed a variable.  Note that there are a number of reserved words which have a specific meaning in the Python language, and which cannot be used as variable names for this reason. The list of reserved words include ‘for’, ‘in’, ‘is’, ‘print’, ‘global’, ‘def’, ‘if, ‘elif’ and ‘else’. \n",

Within the parentheses, you need to mention all the variables whose values you want to print. Additionally, the string that you want to print needs to contain so-called placeholders, on the locations where the values of these variables should appear. These placeholders take the form of an empty set of curly brackets. The number of placeholders needs to be exactly the same as the number of variables mentioned in the format function. The format() returns a formatted string, with all variables simply inserted into the string, on the locations indicated by the placeholders. Listing 1.5 is an illustration. "
